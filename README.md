# Schedule Maker
Scrapes an inputted link relevant to my work to create a Word document of upcoming events.

## How It's Made:

Python Standard Library. External Python libraries: python-docx, beautifulsoup4, pysimplegui, requests, datetime.

This was made to automate a bunch of link clicking, copy/pasting, and formatting to create a weekly schedule document. Even though the GUI takes any link as input, the program was written to scrape a very particular webpage from my work which displays a weekly schedule.
